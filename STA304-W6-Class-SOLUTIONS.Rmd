# Checking Model Assumptions

Recall there are two different types of models that we have covered in STA304: linear regression and logistic regression. Previously we have also talked about how to use R to estimate these models via both Frequentist and Bayesian techniques. Below we will discuss how to check model assumptions for both linear and logistic regression.
